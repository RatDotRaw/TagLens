        <h1>Logseq knowledge base analysis</h1>
        <p>
            This project is generalized. You'll have to supply your own Logseq.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this visualization is to help you understand your own
            knowledge base and find new ways of separating and organize your
            knowledge base. By trying to give a birds eye view combined with
            your fine knowledge of whats inside Logseq, you might find new ways
            of achieving this. This can be done by looking for broader hashtags
            you could use for separating your knowledge base or drawing a line
            in your pages and splitting it into smaller graphs. (or both)
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, you'll have the chance to make notes. Its important to write
            your reasoning down as wel. This later comes in handy when you're
            validating them to see whats important to you and whats not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Know yourself and go scout in your logseq files. A lot of insights
            can be found by getting your hands dirty and by exploring and comparing
            the visual data with your logseq entries. It is important to take
            your time and jump back and forward in your logseq files and notes
            you'll be making.
        </p>
        <p>
            as a quick side note; I'll be refering to 2 different pages types,
            journal and notes. when I talk about journal, I'm talking about
            pages from your journal in logseq (with a date in the title). when I talk about
            notes, I'm talking about pages without a date (everything except
            journal pages).

        <h2>Hashtags-level analysis</h2>
        <div class="left-liner">

            <p id="first-hashtag-date"></p>
            <p id="last-hashtag-date"></p>

            <p id="average-tags"></p>
            <p>
                TODO: do the same sub categories for hashtags as we did for
                words.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Hashtag longegevity</h3>
        <p>
            If you have a big Logseq knowledge base, there are hashtags that are
            bound to be forgotten or only used once.
        </p>
        <p>lets first analyse the hashtag use troughout the year.</p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="HashDateLine"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            now, you you see any spikes in the graph? an influx of new hashtags
            or a sudden drop in usage? That could be a sign of something
            interesting happening. Go look in Logseq around those dates.
        </p>
        <textarea
            class="notes"
            placeholder="Notes you want to make..."
        ></textarea>
        <hr class="dashed" />
        <p>now, what are the most used hashtags?</p>
        <p>Let's first start off with the most used hashtags overall.</p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="HashUse"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Not much insights here... Let's split the hashtags by note and
            journal entry
        </p>
        <p>
            A quick note: if an entry is in both in a note and a journal entry, it
            will be sorted as a journal entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's see how the top hashtags are used in notes and journal
            entries separately.
        </p>

        <div class="chart-container sideBySide">
            <canvas id="HashPage"></canvas>
            <canvas id="HashJournal"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now there is a clear division between your notes and personal life
            (journal). Take a good look at all those hashtags. It's clear that
            you use different hashtags in your journal entries than in your
            pages. now, what are the most used hashtags? They probably have
            somthing to do with an activity you do often. What might be the
            relation between the most used one and their presence in notes and
            journal entries? What are broader or overachting themes a hashtag
            might belong to? Make a little list of those.
        </p>
        <textarea
            class="notes"
            placeholder="Notes you want to make..."
        ></textarea>
        <hr class="dashed" />
        <h2>Page-level analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Pages are a little less interesting to look at, but still could give
            some context and insights for the hashtags.
        </p>
        <p>Lets first take a peak at some broad statistics.</p>
        <div class="left-liner">
            <p id="page-count"></p>
            <p id="journal-to-page-ratio"></p>

            <p id="total-words"></p>
            <p id="average-words"></p>
            <p id="average-words-journal"></p>
            <p id="average-words-page"></p>

            <p id="average-tags"></p>
        </div>

        <p>
            lets take a dive into the logseq pages, and see what we can learn
            from them
        </p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="PageDates"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            I bet this chart may look very familiar to you. It is common for an
            influx of new hashtags to appear around the same time as a new pages
            are added. This is because the new pages are likely to have a lot of
            new hashtags, and these hashtags will be used in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take notes! Why is there an influx or a dip, did something happen
            around that time, what was it related to? why are there more journal
            entries than new pages, where you focussed on something? Go ahead
            and snuff in jour Logseq pages.
