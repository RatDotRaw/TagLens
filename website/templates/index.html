        <h1>Logseq knowledge base analysis</h1>
        <p>
            This project is generalized. You'll have to supply your own Logseq.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this visualization is to help you understand your own
            knowledge base and find new ways of separating and organizing your
            knowledge base. By trying to give a bird's-eye view combined with
            your fine knowledge of what's inside Logseq, you might find new ways
            of achieving this. This can be done by
            <b>
                searching for broader or overarching hashtags that encapsulate a
                bigger topic or theme
            </b>
            , or finding clear points where you can separating your knowledge
            base into multiple smaller graphs. (or both)
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, you'll have the chance to make notes. It's important to write
            your reasoning down as well. This later comes in handy when you're
            validating them to see what's important to you and what's not. You
            get a lot of area to type in, maybe use it for once.
        </p>
        <p>
            Know yourself and go scout in your Logseq files. A lot of insights
            can be found by getting your hands dirty and by exploring and
            comparing the visual data with your Logseq entries. It is important
            to take your time and jump back and forth in your Logseq files and
            notes you'll be making.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a quick side note; I'll be referring to 2 different page types,
            journal and notes. When I talk about journal, I'm talking about
            pages from your journal in Logseq (with a date in the title). When I
            talk about notes, I'm talking about pages without a date (everything
            except journal pages).
        </p>
        <h2>Hashtags-level analysis</h2>
        <div class="left-liner">
            <p id="hashtag-count"></p>
            <p id="first-hashtag-date"></p>
            <p id="last-hashtag-date"></p>
            <p id="average-hashtag-page"></p>

            <p id="average-tags"></p>
            <p>
                TODO: do the same sub categories for hashtags as we did for
                words.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Hashtag Longevity</h3>
        <p>
            If you have a big Logseq knowledge base, there are hashtags that are
            bound to be forgotten or only used once.
        </p>
        <p>Let's first analyze the hashtag usage throughout the year.</p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="HashDateLine"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now, do you see any spikes in the graph? An influx of new hashtags
            or a sudden drop in usage? That could be a sign of something
            interesting happening. Go look in Logseq around those dates.
        </p>
        <textarea
            id="n-h-longegevity"
            class="notes"
            placeholder="Notes you want to make..."
        ></textarea>
        <hr class="dashed" />
        <p>Now, what are the most used hashtags?</p>
        <p>
            Let's first start off by looking at the most used hashtags overall.
        </p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="HashUse"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Not much insight here... Let's split the hashtags by note and
            journal entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            A quick note: If an entry is in both a note and a journal entry, it
            will be sorted as a journal entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's see how the top hashtags are used in notes and journal
            entries separately.
        </p>

        <div class="chart-container sideBySide">
            <canvas id="HashPage"></canvas>
            <canvas id="HashJournal"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now there is a clear division between your notes and personal life
            (journal). Take a good look at all those hashtags. It's clear that
            you use different hashtags in your journal entries than in your
            pages. Now, what are the most used hashtags? They probably have
            something to do with an activity you do often. What might be the
            relation between the most used ones and their presence in notes and
            journal entries? What are broader or overarching themes a hashtag
            might belong to? Make a little list of those.
        </p>
        <textarea
            id="n-h-uses-months"
            class="notes"
            placeholder="Notes you want to make..."
        ></textarea>
        <hr />
        <h2>Page-Level Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Pages are a little less interesting to look at, but still could
            provide some context and insights for the hashtags.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's first take a peek at some broad statistics. Might come in
            handy later.
        </p>
        <div class="left-liner">
            <p id="page-count"></p>
            <p id="journal-to-page-ratio"></p>

            <p id="total-words"></p>
            <p id="average-words"></p>
            <p id="average-words-journal"></p>
            <p id="average-words-page"></p>

            <p id="average-tags"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="small-chart-container">
            <canvas id="PageSentiment"></canvas>
        </div>

        <p>
            Let's take a dive into the Logseq pages, and see what we can learn
            from them.
        </p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="PageDates"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            I bet this chart may look very familiar to you. It is common for an
            influx of new hashtags to appear around the same time as new pages
            are added. This is because the new pages are likely to have a lot of
            new hashtags, and these hashtags will be used in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take notes! Why is there an influx or a dip? What happened around
            that time that explains why so many new notes were created? Was it
            related to something specific? Why are there more journal entries
            than new pages? Where did you focus on something? Go ahead and dive
            into your Logseq pages.
        </p>
        <textarea
            id="n-h-uses-split"
            class="notes"
            placeholder="Notes you want to make..."

        <h2>Mixed Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            So far, we have looked at pages and hashtags separately. Now, let's
            overlay some of the data we have collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take a look at the hashtag amount minus the created pages.
            This should end in a normalized & flat curve. Assuming the hashtag
            per page stays constant, this means that if there's a spike, it
            indicates that one or a few pages have something going on. Go into
            your Logseq files and see what happened.
        </p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="mix_longevity"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now, I took a really long time programming the next graph, so please
            don't ignore it. Look at the evolution of your top 5 sentiments over
            time. Did any notable things happen? Once more, I ask you to look at
            your Logseq pages to find out what happened.
        </p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="sentiment_evolution"></canvas>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            You have taken a broad look and taken a closer look in your Logseq
            files where needed. It's about time we looked at the notes you have
            taken throughout.

            Beatifull notes as they are, but they're not perfect. Lets rewrite
            them to make them more contextually relevant.
            <b>TL;DR: lets make a proper summary of your insights.</b> This will
            help you remember what you were thinking when you wrote it, and also
            help others understand your thoughts better.
        </p>
        <p>Or just copy you're notes.</p>
        <p>Now, here are the notes you took:</p>
        <div class="left-liner">
            <p id="note-view1" class="note-view">
                You didn't take any notes here...
            </p>
            <p id="note-view2" class="note-view">
                You didn't take any notes here...
            </p>
            <p id="note-view3" class="note-view">
                You didn't take any notes here...
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Although there is no text area provided for you, you can still type
            them down in a text editor like Word or Notepad++.
